This is a web app to let you browse Generation 1 Pokemon and build a party from them.

Uses [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) through Nextjs serverless functions to fetch data into a Nextjs front-end.

## Usage

1.  Install with `npm i`
2.  Local development with `npm run dev`
3.  Deploy to hosting of choice (I'm using [now](https://now.sh))
